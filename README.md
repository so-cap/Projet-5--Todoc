# Todoc
**School project**

Todoc is a task managment app. My goal was to persist the data using a local database.

In the "employee" branch you'll find a version of the app that offers to login with either an employee account or administrator account in case of using a cloud database in the future.
You can also find this version on Google PlayStore :

To try this version you'll need these:

  Employee login info:
   - Account 1 - email : sophie@email.com || password : mdp

   - Account 2 - email: john@email.com || password : mdp
  
  Administrator Login info:
     email : admin@email.com || mot de passe : mdp
